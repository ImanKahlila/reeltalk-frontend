                    fees for any feature of the Service, including additional

                    discretion, may make promotional offers with different

                <p className='pl-8'>
                    <strong>4.2 Annual Subscriptions.</strong> If you subscribe
                    annually to the Service, we will renew your annual
                    Subscription until you notify us that you do not wish to
                    renew your annual Subscription by cancelling your
                    subscription via the app or site.{' '}
                </p>

                <p className='pl-8'>
                    <strong>4.3 Monthly Subscriptions. </strong> If you
                    subscribe to the Service on a monthly basis, we will bill
                    your credit or debit account each month for the applicable
                    fees as set forth in this section. We will continue billing
                    your credit or debit account each month until you notify us
                    that you wish to cancel your monthly Subscription by
                    cancelling your subscription via the app or site.

                <p className='pl-8'>
                    <strong>4.4 Authorization.</strong> As a monthly subscriber,
                    you authorize Reel World to charge all sums for your
                    Subscription each month, including all applicable taxes, to
                    the payment method specified in your account.{' '}

                <p className='pl-16'>
                    <strong>a. Recurring Charges.</strong> Monthly Subscriptions
                    include automatically recurring monthly payments (“Recurring
                    Charges”). As a monthly subscriber, you authorize Reel World
                    to periodically charge, on a going-forward basis and until
                    cancellation of your monthly Subscription, all accrued sums
                    on or before the payment due date for the accrued sums. The
                    “Recurring Charge Billing Date” is the date when you
                    purchase your first Subscription to the Service. Your
                    account will be charged automatically on the Recurring
                    Charge Billing Date each month all applicable fees and taxes
                    for the next monthly Subscription period. The Subscription
                    will continue unless and until you cancel your monthly
                    Subscription or your payment account, or your subscription
                    is otherwise terminated as set forth herein. You must cancel
                    your Subscription before it renews in order to avoid billing
                    of the next periodic Recurring Charge to your account. We
                    will bill the periodic Recurring Charge to the payment
                    method you provide to us during registration (or to a
                    different payment method if you change your payment
                    information).{' '}

                    fee-based portions of the Service, for any account for which
                    any amount is due but unpaid. In addition to the amount due
                    for the Service, a delinquent account will be charged with
                    fees or charges that are incidental to any chargeback or
                    collection of any the unpaid amount, including collection
                    fees.{' '}

                <strong>16. Dispute Resolution and Arbitration</strong>

                <p className='pl-8'>
                    <strong>16.1 Generally. </strong> In the interest of
                    resolving disputes between you and Reel World in the most
                    expedient and cost effective manner, and except as described
                    in Section 16.2, you and Reel World agree that every dispute
                    arising in connection with these Terms will be resolved by
                    binding arbitration. Arbitration is less formal than a
                    lawsuit in court. Arbitration uses a neutral arbitrator
                    instead of a judge or jury, may allow for more limited
                    discovery than in court, and can be subject to very limited
                    review by courts. Arbitrators can award the same damages and
                    relief that a court can award. This agreement to arbitrate
                    disputes includes all claims arising out of or relating to
                    any aspect of these Terms, whether based in contract, tort,
                    statute, fraud, misrepresentation, or any other legal
                    theory, and regardless of whether a claim arises during or
                    after the termination of these Terms. YOU UNDERSTAND AND
                    AGREE THAT, BY ENTERING INTO THESE TERMS, YOU AND REEL WORLD
                    ARE EACH WAIVING THE RIGHT TO A TRIAL BY JURY OR TO
                    PARTICIPATE IN A CLASS ACTION.
                </p>

                <p className='pl-8'>
                    <strong>16.2 Exceptions. </strong> Despite the provisions of
                    Section 16.1, nothing in these Terms will be deemed to
                    waive, preclude, or otherwise limit the right of either
                    party to: (a) bring an individual action in small claims
                    court; (b) pursue an enforcement action through the
                    applicable federal, state, or local agency if that action is
                    available; (c) seek injunctive relief in a court of law in
                    aid of arbitration; or (d) to file suit in a court of law to
                    address an intellectual property infringement claim.

                    <strong>16.3 Arbitrator. </strong> Any arbitration between

                    Arbitration Act and administered by the American Arbitration

                    <strong>16.4 Notice of Arbitration; Process. </strong> A
                    party who intends to seek arbitration must first send a
                    written notice of the dispute to the other party by
                    certified U.S. Mail or by Federal Express (signature
                    required) or, only if that other party has not provided a
                    current physical address, then by electronic mail (“Notice
                    of Arbitration”). Reel World’s address for Notice is:{' '}

                    </Link>
                    . The Notice of Arbitration must: (a) describe the nature
                    and basis of the claim or dispute; and (b) set forth the
                    specific relief sought (“Demand”). The parties will make
                    good faith efforts to resolve the claim directly, but if the
                    parties do not reach an agreement to do so within 30 days
                    after the Notice of Arbitration is received, you or Reel
                    World may commence an arbitration proceeding. All
                    arbitration proceedings between the parties will be
                    confidential unless otherwise agreed by the parties in
                    writing. During the arbitration, the amount of any
                    settlement offer made by you or Reel World must not be
                    disclosed to the arbitrator until after the arbitrator makes
                    a final decision and award, if any. If the arbitrator awards
                    you an amount higher than the last written settlement amount
                    offered by Reel World in settlement of the dispute prior to
                    the award, Reel World will pay to you the higher of: (i) the
                    amount awarded by the arbitrator; or (ii) $10,000.
                </p>

                <p className='pl-8'>
                    <strong>16.5 Fees. </strong> If you commence arbitration in
                    accordance with these Terms, Reel World will reimburse you
                    for your payment of the filing fee, unless your claim is for
                    more than $10,000, in which case the payment of any fees
                    will be decided by the AAA Rules. Any arbitration hearing
                    will take place at a location to be agreed upon in San
                    Francisco, California, but if the claim is for $10,000 or
                    less, you may choose whether the arbitration will be
                    conducted: (a) solely on the basis of documents submitted to
                    the arbitrator; (b) through a non-appearance based telephone
                    hearing; or (c) by an in-person hearing as established by
                    the AAA Rules in the county (or parish) of your billing
                    address. If the arbitrator finds that either the substance
                    of your claim or the relief sought in the Demand is
                    frivolous or brought for an improper purpose (as measured by
                    the standards set forth in Federal Rule of Civil Procedure
                    11(b)), then the payment of all fees will be governed by the
                    AAA Rules. In that case, you agree to reimburse Reel World
                    for all monies previously disbursed by it that are otherwise
                    your obligation to pay under the AAA Rules. Regardless of
                    the manner in which the arbitration is conducted, the
                    arbitrator must issue a reasoned written decision sufficient
                    to explain the essential findings and conclusions on which
                    the decision and award, if any, are based. The arbitrator
                    may make rulings and resolve disputes as to the payment and
                    reimbursement of fees or expenses at any time during the
                    proceeding and upon request from either party made within 14
                    days of the arbitrator’s ruling on the merits.
